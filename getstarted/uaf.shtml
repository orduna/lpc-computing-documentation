<h1>Connect to LPC Cluster</h1>

<p>The LPC cluster is a group of interactive nodes running <a href="https://fermilinux.fnal.gov" target="_blank">Scientific Linux Fermi (or SL)</a> that LPC users are able to connect to, to develop and debug their code, submit jobs, do analysis, and so on. It is divided in two main sets of computers according to the major version of SL they are running, currently versions 5 or 6, in the following way:</p>

<p><center><a href="./images/cmslpc.png" target="_blank"><img src="./images/cmslpc.png" width="100%"></a></center></p><br><br>

<p>Most operative systems with OpenSSH configured with GSSAPI and Kerberos configured for the FNAL.GOV realm should be able to connect to the LPC cluster.</p>

<p>It is assumed that you already have a Fermilab ID and Kerberos principal. If not visit the "<a href="/uscms_at_work/physics/computing/getstarted/getaccount.shtml">Get an Account</a>" section.</p>

<p>Access to the LPC cluster is controlled by a switch which redirects incoming connections to individual nodes and this page should serve as a guide on how to connect to the LPC cluster in most typical situations.</p>

<div class="all-questions">

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<h3 id="prerequisiteKerberosConfig">Kerberos configuration file</h3>

<p>To connect to the LPC cluster you need to have Kerberos installed on your system. This is already included in Scientific Linux and OS X. In addtion you will need to get the krb5.conf file for Fermilab that corresponds to your specific OS. You can download this file from: <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/authentication/krb5conf/">Fermilab Kerberos Configuration Files</a>.</p>

<p>Save the appropriate file to your home directory and then run (depending on your system, you will be prompted for you root or admin password):</p>

<p><pre><font color="black">[localMachine:Desktop localUser]$</font> <font color=blue>sudo mv -v krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf</font>
<font color=green>Password:
krb5.conf -> /etc/krb5.conf</font></pre></p>

<p>Once done, the file will be moved to the appropriate location on your system. Note: if you already have a <code>krb5.conf</code> file, it is a good idea to backup it up before placing the new file.</p>

<p><code>krb5.conf</code> is a text file that you can review and compare to the one found on <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/authentication/krb5conf/">Fermilab Kerberos Configuration Files</a> to determine whether you already have the most recent one or you need to update it.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisiteSSHConfig">SSH configuration file</h3>

<p>In order to give SSH the proper configuration to login to the LPC cluster, make sure the following lines are present in your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file (depending on your OS):</p>

<p><pre><font color="black">[localMachine:Desktop localUser]$</font> <font color=blue>more ~/.ssh/config</font>

<h2 id="connectFromLinuxOrOSX">Connecting to the LPC cluster</h2>

<p>Once your system has the appropriate <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a> to connect to the LPC cluster, do the following to login.</p>

<h3 id="getKerberosTicket">Get a Kerberos ticket</h3>

<p>A valid Kerberos ticket for the FNAL.GOV Kerberos realm is needed to login to the LPC cluster, you can get one from your terminal by doing:</p>

<p><pre><font color="black">[localMachine:Desktop localUser]$</font> <font color=blue>kinit <i>username</i>@FNAL.GOV</font>
<font color="red">- - - - - - LINUX - - - - - -</font>

<font color="red">- - - - - - LINUX - - - - - -</font>

<font color="red">- - - - - - OS X - - - - - -</font>
<font color=green><i>username</i>@FNAL.GOV's password:</font>
<font color="red">- - - - - - OS X - - - - - -</font>
</pre></p>

<p>if successful, there is no output to this command. You can always verify that a Kerberos ticket was created by issuing the following command:</p>

<p><pre><font color="black">[localMachine:Desktop localUser]$</font> <font color=blue>klist</font>

<!--p><h2>Connecting to the LPC Cluster from a Windows PC</h2> (to be reviewed)</p>

<p>Connecting to the LPC cluster through the round-robin queue from a Windows PC is known to work with Kerberized PuTTY. Other terminal programs such as WRQ Relection ssh and openssh for Cygwin only work with the direct access nodes (see above). Directions are given below for establishing a connection to the LPC cluster with Kerberized PuTTY. Directions for installing Cygwin/X or Xming, both free X servers for Windows, are also given. These packages are optional since commercial alternatives such as WRQ Reflection and Exceed exist. Also included are directions for using WinSCP and OpenAFS for Windows to access files in your account.</p>
    

<h3>Kerberos and SSH:</h3>
    
<p>Version 0.62 of PuTTY supports Kerberos authentication for SSH on Windows and can be found at <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a>. Download the Installer  to your desktop and run it. Putty will be installed in c:/Program Files/Putty. You will also need to download and install MIT Kerberos for Windows. The installer can be found at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/www/dist/index.html"> the MIT Kerberos download page</a>. In addtion you will need get the <a href="http://security.fnal.gov/krb5.conf">krb5.conf file for Fermilab</a> and save it to \Windows\krb5.ini replacing this file if it exists.</p>
    
<p>To get your Kerberos ticket:<br /> 
    Select Start ->All Programs->Kerberos for Windows->Network Identity Manager<br /> 
    Enter your Kerberos principal, password and FNAL.GOV for the realm and click Login.</p>

<h3>Kerberos and SFTP:</h3> 
    

<p>WinSCP supports Kerberos authentication for SFTP on Windows can be downloaded from <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">http://winscp.net/eng/index.php</a>. Follow the directions <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_authentication">here</a> check Advanced options and under SSH->Authentication check both boxes for GSSAPI Authentication. Use this program to transfer files to and from the LPC cluster.</p>
    

<h3>X servers:</h3>
    
<p><a href="http://x.cygwin.com"/>Cygwin/X</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/"/>Xming</a>  are implementations of X11 on the Windows platform. With X11 forwarding enabled in PuTTY and an X server running, programs like Root and emacs can be displayed on the Windows desktop.</p>
    
<p>To install Cygwin/X follow the download and installation directions from the user's guide. </p>

    
<p>After installing Cygwin/X copy c:\cygwin\X11R6\bin\startxwin.bat to the desktop. Edit startxwin.bat and remove the line <br />
    run xterm -e /usr/bin/bash -l </p>
    

<p>To start the Xserver double click on startxwin.bat.</p>
    

<h3>OpenAFS:</h3>
    
<p>Files from your afs home area can be accessed through AFS. The OpenAFS client for Windows allows users to access their files in AFS.</p>
    
<p>The OpenAFS client for Windows can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.openafs.org/pages/windows.html">here</a>.</p>
    
<p>During the installation enter fnal.gov as the AFS cell. After installation is complete you will be required to reboot to activate the OpenAFS client. After rebooting the OpenAFS client will prompt you to enter your AFS username and password to obtain an AFS ticket. This prompt can be canceled since the AFS ticket can be obtained using aklog.</p>
    
<p>To get your AFS ticket: <br />
    Obtain your Kerberos ticket as described above. <br />
    

    <p>To access AFS files: <br> <br>
